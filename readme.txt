Adsotrans provides mouseover popups for all UTF8 encoded Chinese text in any post.

== Description ==

Adsotrans is an annotation service for Chinese text. This plug lets users click on all UTF8 encoded Chinese text for mouseover popups in the popular Adso format. This allows readers to view and understand Chinese content easily and understand the contextual meaning of the content. Users can also edit Adso dictionary content, pushing forward the limits of machine translation.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `adsotrans.php` to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. This will wrap
your post/comments with the needed span tags to support mouseover annotation.

3. Edit the file header.php and stick the four lines below immediately after
your opening BODY tag. If you are already using jquery you don't need to
re-download the scripts. But do be sure to put the DIV tags before the javascript!

<div id="adso_tooltip"></div>
<div id="adso_pointer"></div>
<script language="javascript" src="http://adsotrans.com/wordpress/js/jquery-1.2.2.pack.js"></script>
<script language="javascript" src="http://adsotrans.com/wordpress/js/api.js"></script>
